# Welcome to the CallstackLibrary!
The CallstackLibrary is a library designed to create human-readable callstacks for natively compiled applications.

It can be used with pure **C**, although some optimizations and features using **C++** optionally can be enabled.

Its API is available for both **C** and **C++**.

## Quickstart
Use the CallstackLibrary for creating human-readable callstacks and for creating C++ exceptions that can print their
stacktrace.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/mhahnFr/CallstackLibrary.git`
2. Build it: `cd CallstackLibrary && make`
3. Link your code with `-L<path/to/library> -lcallstack -ldl`

Now, you can use the headers [``callstack.h``][2] and [``callstack_exception.hpp``][5], respectively.

## Usage
### Installation
Get started by either downloading a prebuilt version of this library [here][1].
Alternatively you can also build it from source:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/mhahnFr/CallstackLibrary.git`
2. go into the cloned repository: `cd CallstackLibrary`
3. and build the library: `make`

> **Note**: On some systems, you might need to install the `libexecinfo-dev` to compile the library successfully.
> 
> If this is the case, add `-lexecinfo` to your linking flags: `-L<path/to/library> -lcallstack -ldl -lexecinfo`

Or in one step:
```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/mhahnFr/CallstackLibrary.git && cd CallstackLibrary && make
```

To enable the optional optimizations using **C++** add `CXX_OPTIMIZED=true` as argument to `make`, for the optional
**C++** exclusive functions add `CXX_FUNCTIONS=true` as argument.  
**Example**:
```shell
make CXX_OPTIMIZED=true CXX_FUNCTIONS=true
```

Once you have a copy of the CallstackLibrary you can install it using the following command:
```shell
make INSTALL_PATH=/usr/local install
```
If you downloaded a release you can simply move the headers and the library anywhere you like.

### How to use
In order to use this library, simply include the header [``callstack.h``][2].

**Linking**:
- On **macOS**, link using these flags: ``-L<path/to/library> -lcallstack``.
- On **Linux**, link with ``-rdynamic -L<path/to/library> -lcallstack -ldl``.
- On **FreeBSD**, link with ``-rdynamic -L<path/to/library> -lcallstack -ldl -lexecinfo``.

The complete set of features is described in the [wiki][3].
